- [x] Remove the `Log` setting and instead if there is a value for the logs files `logs.log` than its true, but if its empty than its false.
- [x] On the user agent and proxy, people can add nothing and it will be true, lets make sure people are putting in some value in there before they can add new things.
- [x] Can we make it so instead of declaring `JSON|CSV|XML` from the list we just read the file extension from the output filename and do those formats.
- [x] Bug fixing && Code Cleanup && Code Optimizations
